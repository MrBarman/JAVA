### What are Lambdas ?
    - A lambda expression can be understood as a kind of anonymous function: it doesnot hav a name,
      but it has a list of parameters, a body, a return type and also exceptions that can be thrown
    - Lambda can only be used where a functional interface is expected
    - Lambdas are allowed to reference static and instance variables in their bodies 
      but local variables have to be final
